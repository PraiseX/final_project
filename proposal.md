Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. 
Please include a general description of a project, 
and list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript etc.). 
Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request. 
Submit a PR to turn it in by Monday, September 27th at11:59 PM. Only one pull request is required per team.
